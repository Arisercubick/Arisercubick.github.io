				<h2>Happy birthday, Lola Putli.</h2>
				<p>May this day unfold like a gentle melody; marvellous, radiant, and serene.</p>
				<p>Your years upon this earth have painted constellations in the hearts of those who know you;</p>
				<p>each chapter of your life, a verse in the song of time,</p>
				<p>each moment we shared, a jewel I have guarded tenderly within memoryâ€™s quiet vault.</p>
				<br>
				<p>How the seasons have turned, yet the warmth of your laughter still lingers in the corridors of my mind.</p>
				<p>I find myself tracing the echoes of our days, soft glimmers of joy,</p>
				<p>like sunlight slipping through leaves after the rain.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I dream that one day, when the stars are kind, our paths may once more entwine;</p>
				<p>that the universe, in its infinite grace, might let our stories meet again.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Until that destined hour, I send forth my fondest wish</p>
				<p>that your journey ahead be adorned with beauty, wisdom, and peace.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Happy birthday, dear Lola Putli</p>
				<p>May your heart remain as luminous as the skies you were born beneath,</p>
				<p>and may every tomorrow greet you with gentle wonder.</p>
